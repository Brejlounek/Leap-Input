Leap-Input
=========

C# app for basic mouse movement and WASD emulation.

Move your finger or tool on the XY plane, cursor will follow. Sensitivity and y-offset can be set (there is some visible stutter on highest sensitivity with highspeed mode).
Checking WASD disables mouse and enables WASD emulation. This attemps to emulate WASD keys in analog manner - keys are pressed and released repetadly for amounts of time given by hand position and rotation.
Open your hand above the leap and roll it left and right to steer, move it forward to accelerate and backward to brake. You can set WS and AD sensitivity.
I know this type of managing WASD keys sounds really stupid, but it works! :D Maybe there is some bigger latency.
